            <p class="list-item__title">2. RISK WARNING</p>
            <p class="list-item__description">
              2.1 Buying, selling and investing in cryptocurrencies can be risky. The risk of loss
              in trading or holding cryptocurrency can be substantial. You should therefore
              carefully consider whether trading or holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in
              light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold
              cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of cryptocurrency can
              change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. 2.2 The cryptocurrencies
              market information relating to the past performance of an investment is not
              necessarily a guide to its performance in the future. The value of investments or
              income from them may go down as well as up. Like stocks and shares as well,
              cryptocurrencies are valued from second to second, their bid and offer value
              fluctuates sometimes widely. The degrees of fluctuation of prices vary significantly
              and the value of higher volatility funds may change suddenly. The value of investments
              may rise or fall due to the volatility of world markets, interest rates and capital
              values or, for investments held in overseas markets, changes in the rate of exchange
              in the currency in which the investments are denominated. You may not necessarily get
              back the amount you invested. 2.3 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading also
              has certain risks which can cause a complete loss to zero. As cryptocurrencies are no
              official currency and the legal status is still undefined, their legal nature is
              subject of change under different jurisdictions. Unlike official currencies, which are
              backed up by governments or other legal entities like the FED, ECB or others,
              cryptocurrencies are a private currency, generated by all the world. There is no
              central bank that could take corrective measures to protect the value of the
              cryptocurrencies at a possible crisis. 2.4 You know and understand cryptocurrency
              trading could be affected by hackers, change of laws, official restrictions, frauds,
              technical issues, collapse of infrastructure and many other possible threats. 2.5 All
              content provided through this website is only for your personal information and use,
              and is not intended to address your particular requirements or to be relied upon in
              making (or refraining from making) any specific investment or other decision. Such
              content shall not constitute any form of advice or recommendation by Coinbistex.
              Furthermore, there may be additional risks that Coinbistex have not foreseen or named
              in this Terms of Use. 2.6 Coinbistex does not provide any investment advice in
              connection with the services contemplated by these Terms of Use. We only provide
              information on the price, range, volatility of cryptocurrencies. Any decisions to buy
              or sell cryptocurrencies are made on your decision solely. Coinbistex will not be
              liable for any loss you might face. 2.7 If you are unsure about any specific
              investment or other decision, you should obtain appropriate expert independent advice
              and assess carefully whether your financial background is suitable for trading
              cryptocurrencies. Your decisions and investments are subject to your personal
              responsibility.

            <p class="list-item__description">
              7.1 External fees. Every cryptocurrency transaction must be added to the blockchain,
              the official public ledger of all completed transactions, in order to be considered a
              successful and valid transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to
              the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers that make up a portion
              of the network and confirm its transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing
              power and energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a collection of
              transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty called a block reward, as well as
              all fees sent with the transactions that were confirmed and included in the block. For
              this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the validation of
              transactions that include a higher fee. For someone looking to send funds and get a
              quick confirmation, the appropriate fee to include depends on the cryptocurrency being
              sent and can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors, such as transaction size
              and network conditions. Your wallet will automatically calculate the appropriate fee
              for sending your chosen cryptocurrency. The fee for sending ether is static (you can
              view the fee for sending ether by clicking “Send” and selecting Ether as the
              currency), while the fees for sending bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic
              and will be calculated by your wallet after you input the amount you want to send.
              This article explains bitcoin transaction fees in greater detail. 7.2 Internal fees.
              The Our Digital Exchange shall enable matching of buy and sell orders between Users.
              The latest information on the time for settlement of any transactions and the costs

              deposits, and for all withdrawals (1%). We trade at a variable percentage above market
              rate to cover our operating costs and to allow our vendors to make a profit. The
              trade-off for this is ease of use and the speed of the service - we're not the
              cheapest, but we try to be the best! Everything depends on the loading of our system
              and the magnitude of the operation. 7.3 Collection-Related Costs. If you fail to pay
              fees or any other amounts owed to Payward under these Terms and Payward refers your
              account(s) to a third party for collection, then Payward will charge you the lesser of
              an 10% collection fee or the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, to cover
              Payward's collection-related costs. 7.4 At the first withdrawal of funds, users must
              pay a tax of 10% of the amount of your withdrawal. (One-time)

              transaction must be confirmed and recorded in the public ledger associated with the
              relevant cryptocurrency network (e.g. the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network).
              That cryptocurrency network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming any
              such transactions. Coinbistex cannot confirm, cancel or reverse transactions on a
              cryptocurrency network, other than confirming to you that the network has completed
              the transaction. 10.2 Once submitted to a cryptocurrency network, a transaction will
              be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction
              by the network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds

              Coinbistex Account, you are authorising us to submit your transaction request to the

              request and neither you or Coinbistex will be able to cancel or otherwise modify your
              transaction. Cryptocurrency networks are operated by decentralised networks of

              not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the cryptocurrency network used
              to process the transaction. 10.3 SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT: Coinbistex is not
